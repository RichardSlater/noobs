#### How to access the shell or SSH into NOOBS

1. Even if the NOOBS GUI is launched, the busybox shell can still be accessed by pressing CTRL-ALT-F2. Use CTL-ALT-F1 to get back to the gui. 

2. You can now also SSH into the NOOBS basic busybox shell. To enable this feature, add `ssh` to the argument list in the recovery.cmdline. SSH is also accessible from the rescueshell, but allow 5 seconds after boot to allow the network to establish. NOOBS SSH does not store any keys so it takes a while to connect at first after each boot as it generates new keys for that session.

Use the username of 'root' and password 'raspberry' to login to the shell via the console or SSH.
